In this project, by using a set of ML algorithms, a computational intelligence approach is applied to detect spam mails. The given dataset was utilised for training and testing the Logistic Regression, KNN Classification, Support Vector Classification, GradientBoosting Classification, Decision Tree and Random Forest Classification, ML algorithms. The classification analysis of this dataset followed the steps of data splitting, preprocessing, Fitting the classification models, and evaluation. The resultant outcome revealed that RandomForest Classification achieved highest accuracy score.
